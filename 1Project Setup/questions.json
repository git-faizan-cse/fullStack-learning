    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a JavaScript data type?",
      "options": ["String", "Number", "Boolean", "Character"],
      "correctAnswer": "Character",
      "explanation": "JavaScript has six primitive data types: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, and Symbol, plus the Object type. Character is not a built-in data type in JavaScript - individual characters are represented using String type."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is the result of `typeof null` in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["null", "undefined", "object", "number"],
      "correctAnswer": "object",
      "explanation": "In JavaScript, `typeof null` returns 'object'. This is a known historical bug in JavaScript that has persisted for backward compatibility. Despite null being a primitive value, typeof null returns 'object' due to its original implementation."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which method is used to add an element at the end of an array?",
      "options": ["push()", "pop()", "shift()", "unshift()"],
      "correctAnswer": "push()",
      "explanation": "Array.push() adds one or more elements to the end of an array. pop() removes from the end, shift() removes from the beginning, and unshift() adds to the beginning of the array."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What will `2 + '2'` evaluate to in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["4", "22", "NaN", "undefined"],
      "correctAnswer": "22",
      "explanation": "When adding a number and a string with '+', JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of arithmetic addition. So 2 (number) is converted to '2' (string) and then concatenated with '2', resulting in '22'."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which keyword is used to declare a constant variable in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["let", "const", "var", "constant"],
      "correctAnswer": "const",
      "explanation": "const is used to declare constants in JavaScript. Once declared, these variables cannot be reassigned. 'constant' is not a valid keyword, 'let' and 'var' are used for declaring regular variables."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is the value of an uninitialized variable in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["null", "undefined", "0", "NaN"],
      "correctAnswer": "undefined",
      "explanation": "When a variable is declared but not initialized in JavaScript, it automatically gets the value 'undefined'. This is different from null, which must be explicitly assigned."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which operator checks for both value and type equality in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["==", "===", "=", "!="],
      "correctAnswer": "===",
      "explanation": "The strict equality operator (===) checks both value and type, while == only checks value after type coercion. For example, '5' === 5 is false, but '5' == 5 is true."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Which array method does NOT return a new array?",
      "options": ["map()", "forEach()", "filter()", "reduce()"],
      "correctAnswer": "forEach()",
      "explanation": "forEach() is used for iterating over array elements and executing a function for each element, but it doesn't return a new array. map(), filter(), and reduce() all return new values."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which statement is used for handling runtime errors in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["if...else", "try...catch", "switch...case", "for...in"],
      "correctAnswer": "try...catch",
      "explanation": "The try...catch statement is used to handle runtime errors (exceptions) in JavaScript. The code that might throw an error goes in the try block, and the error handling goes in the catch block."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which array method transforms each element and returns a new array?",
      "options": ["filter()", "map()", "reduce()", "indexOf()"],
      "correctAnswer": "map()",
      "explanation": "map() creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element, transforming each element according to the provided function."
    },
     {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Which symbol is used for comments in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["//", "/* */", "#", "<!-- -->"],
      "correctAnswer": "//",
      "explanation": "Single-line comments in JavaScript use //, while multi-line comments use /* */. # and <!-- --> are not valid in JavaScript."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What does NaN stand for in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["Not a Null", "Not a Number", "New array Number", "Negative and Null"],
      "correctAnswer": "Not a Number",
      "explanation": "NaN stands for Not a Number, and it represents a value that is not a valid number, often resulting from invalid arithmetic operations."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which function is used to parse a string into an integer?",
      "options": ["parseFloat()", "parseInt()", "Number()", "toInteger()"],
      "correctAnswer": "parseInt()",
      "explanation": "parseInt() parses a string and returns an integer. parseFloat() parses a string into a floating-point number, while Number() converts to a number in general."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Which keyword is used to define a function in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["func", "function", "def", "fn"],
      "correctAnswer": "function",
      "explanation": "The function keyword is used to define functions in JavaScript. func, def, and fn are not valid JavaScript keywords."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Which built-in method removes the last element from an array?",
      "options": ["shift()", "pop()", "push()", "splice()"],
      "correctAnswer": "pop()",
      "explanation": "The pop() method removes the last element from an array. shift() removes the first element, push() adds to the end, and splice() modifies the array in place."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Which operator is used to assign a value to a variable?",
      "options": ["=", "==", "===", "=>"],
      "correctAnswer": "=",
      "explanation": "The = operator assigns a value to a variable. == and === are comparison operators, while => is used in arrow functions."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "What does the break statement do in JavaScript loops?",
      "options": ["Skips current iteration", "Stops the loop entirely", "Pauses loop temporarily", "Restarts loop"],
      "correctAnswer": "Stops the loop entirely",
      "explanation": "The break statement immediately exits the loop. To skip the current iteration, use the continue statement."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "What is the default value of an object property that has not been assigned?",
      "options": ["null", "0", "undefined", "empty string"],
      "correctAnswer": "undefined",
      "explanation": "If an object property is accessed but not assigned a value, it returns undefined."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Which operator is used to combine conditions in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["&&", "||", "!", "Both && and ||"],
      "correctAnswer": "Both && and ||",
      "explanation": "&& is used for logical AND, || is used for logical OR, and ! is used for negation."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Which method converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object?",
      "options": ["JSON.parse()", "JSON.stringify()", "Object.parse()", "toObject()"],
      "correctAnswer": "JSON.parse()",
      "explanation": "JSON.parse() is used to parse a JSON string into a JavaScript object. JSON.stringify() does the reverse."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Which method is used to join elements of an array into a string?",
      "options": ["concat()", "join()", "push()", "slice()"],
      "correctAnswer": "join()",
      "explanation": "join() concatenates all elements of an array into a single string. concat() merges arrays, push() adds elements, and slice() extracts a portion."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "What does the continue statement do in JavaScript loops?",
      "options": ["Ends the loop", "Skips current iteration", "Restarts loop", "Throws an error"],
      "correctAnswer": "Skips current iteration",
      "explanation": "The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "What is the output of `Boolean('false')`?",
      "options": ["true", "false", "undefined", "NaN"],
      "correctAnswer": "true",
      "explanation": "Any non-empty string is truthy in JavaScript. Therefore, Boolean('false') returns true, even though the string says 'false'."
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "Which function is used to schedule code execution after a delay?",
      "options": ["setInterval()", "setTimeout()", "sleep()", "wait()"],
      "correctAnswer": "setTimeout()",
      "explanation": "setTimeout() executes code after a specified delay. setInterval() repeatedly executes code at intervals. JavaScript does not have sleep() or wait()."
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Which function repeatedly executes code at specified intervals?",
      "options": ["setInterval()", "setTimeout()", "repeat()", "loop()"],
      "correctAnswer": "setInterval()",
      "explanation": "setInterval() calls a function repeatedly at given time intervals. setTimeout() executes only once."
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "What will `typeof NaN` return?",
      "options": ["number", "NaN", "undefined", "object"],
      "correctAnswer": "number",
      "explanation": "Although NaN means 'Not a Number', its type is 'number' in JavaScript. This is part of JavaScript's type system."

      "id": 27,
      "question": "Which method is used to remove the first element from an array?",
      "options": ["shift()", "pop()", "unshift()", "slice()"],
      "correctAnswer": "shift()",
      "explanation": "The shift() method removes the first element of an array. pop() removes the last, unshift() adds to the start, and slice() extracts without modifying."
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "What is the correct way to declare an array in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["var arr = [];", "var arr = {};", "var arr = ();", "var arr = <>;"],
      "correctAnswer": "var arr = [];",
      "explanation": "Arrays in JavaScript are declared using square brackets []. {} creates an object, () is not valid, and <> is not used in JS."
    },
    {
